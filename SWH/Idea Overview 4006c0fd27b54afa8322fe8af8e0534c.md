# Idea Overview

# Street-Ware-House (SWH)

## Overview

The main idea is to create a common marketplace (Website and App) for the emerging streetwear fashion and integrate all modern or GenZ preferred wearables into it by collaborating with all the streetwear brands establishing and emerging in India as new startups.

Just like Myntra and ajio are a common place for all fashion brands to sell there products , SWH would be a place where you would get everything related to streetwear fashion that exists in india.

This will not only include brands but will also be open for sellers who want to sell imported sneakers, or SWH will start it’s own service of importing and selling sneakers in India at later stage.
