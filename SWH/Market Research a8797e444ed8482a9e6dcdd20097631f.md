# Market Research

First we need to do all the market research to actually get an idea about even if it worth it to go forward and put our time in this idea.

We need :

- market size
- all the numerical data
- problems that we might face in accordance with what all we are gonna do if we process.
- if money would be needed to put in
- Upcoming tech we might benefit us or create a problem for us
- SWOT analysis
- All e-commerce websites that sell something :
    - what do they do
    - how do they do
    - whatâ€™s different in the ones that are doing good and what is there in the ones doing bad or lower on the revenue list
    - customer base formed by them
    - The followers , likes & comments v/s actual buyers
